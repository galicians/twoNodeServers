## Two web servers to help with mechanics of node

This is just a starting point(sandbox) that can be used to ilustrate the following concepts in node:

 - asynchronous calls and the event loop
 - reading and writing the response and request objects
 - get and post http methods
 - http node package
 - and specially *** promises ***

 To install this:
 - git clone https://github.com/galicians/twoNodeServers on your machine
 - npm install
 - node app.js
 - visit http://localhost:3000/ and you should see: Hello Makers, I'm server One
 - visit http://localhost:5000/ and you should see:Hello Makers, I'm server Two
